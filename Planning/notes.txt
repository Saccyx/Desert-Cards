- Classical percolation is a toy model in which one deletes nodes from a low-dimensional regular lattice and computes different properties, statistical and geometrical, of the remaining isolated clusters.
 
- Most studies use simple removal rules:
	- Random removal: knock out nodes uniformly at random.
	- Topology-based: remove by a network measure (e.g., highest degree, highest betweenness).
- However… empirical applications require more sophisticated protocols… combining topology and metadata.
	- Need to use both the position of the "node" in the network alongside metadata, an example may be vaccinating people (feature = risk/age) and targeting super-spreaders (topology = degree).
- The Novel Idea Presented, "We propose a novel mathematical framework… networks are enriched with features and nodes are removed by importance in feature space."
	-The authors add a formal way to attach features to each node (numbers, categories, vectors) and define removal rules that act on those features (e.g., “remove nodes with risk score above a threshold” or “remove the most central among high-risk nodes”).
- “Our framework not only generalizes percolation… but offers an accurate way to test robustness in realistic scenarios.”
	- This extends classic percolation (which only looked at topology or randomness) to feature-aware percolation, letting you evaluate robustness under realistic, data-driven intervention policies—closer to how failures or interventions actually happen.

Quick analogy

Think of closing facilities in a city network during an outbreak. Classic percolation: close places at random or by busiest hubs. This paper: close places based on real attributes like crowd density, ventilation grade, or infection risk (features), possibly combined with how central they are in the network (topology). This gives a truer picture of how the city’s connectivity will hold up.

2. Motivation & Importance
What motivated this research?
- Both researchers are in the physics field and describe the development of the theory of critical phenomena to be the event that brought the toy model of Classical Percolation to the forefront of the physics community
- There are two stated reasons for its rise in fame
	1. Percolation provided stimulating theoretical challenges, considered one of the simplest models displaying a phase transition, without any need of introducing dynamics or thermodynamics quantities, as it occurs in the Ising model
	2. percolation was flexible enough in its definition to be mapped to many diverse problems, such as the dielectric response of inhomogeneous materials , epidemiology or flows in porous media, among many other  

Why is the problem studied in this paper important (in theory, practice, or both)?
Provide background context so the audience understands the relevance.
- The interest in percolation is renewed with the advent of modern network theory
	- Since in networks the degree of nodes is distributed heterogeneously, one can exploit this fact to devise new physically meaningful removal strategies, such as targeting nodes from higher to lower degree. These interventions on the networks are called attacks since they are intentionally performed using some a priori information.
	- Studying percolation based on degree attacks elucidates the role played by large degree nodes, the hubs, on the network robustness. For instance, graphs with long-tailed degree distributions are very weak to hub removal, that is, by removing a very small number of hubs the network is broken into many small components. This has catastrophic consequences for the security of real-world networks since many of them display such degree distributions
	-This has catastrophic consequences for the security of real-world networks since many of them display such degree distributions

3. Research Gap
What are the limitations or problems of existing research?
- Previous models of percolation based on either random or topological removal techniques did not accurately represent real world networks where features related to nodes are also considered alongside topological data


What is the research gap this paper tries to fill?
- "The degree is the most basic centrality measure in complex networks. However, there exist a plethora of alternatives to assess the importance of a node within a graph 22–24 , and accordingly, we can test the importance of these variables on the network robustness by performing attacks based on them25–27 and evaluate how far is each attack strategy from being optimal 28 .Moreover, nodes could be characterized by non-topological properties as well, such as age 29 , biomass 30 , or bank credibility 31 . Hence, similar network attacks can be implemented to test percolation properties of the system when a group of nodes with certain characteristics is removed, for instance, those users of online social platforms generating or spreading hateful content 10 . "


Why are the authors well-positioned to address this gap (e.g., new dataset, novel method, unique insight)?
- We tackle therefore the challenge of developing a percolation framework that accounts for both topological and non-topological information simultaneously. 
- The latter element will be considered as node metadata, what we call the features.
- We generalize standard message-passing methods by introducing a joint degree-feature probability density function on the network.
